LMC (Let Me Cook - Infopercept) Security Solution is a robust and versatile free and open-source platform designed for threat prevention, detection, and response across diverse IT environments, including on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based systems. :shield:

## Key Use Cases and Capabilities :key:

1. **Intrusion Detection** :mag_right:
   - LMC agents perform comprehensive scans of monitored systems to identify malware, rootkits, and suspicious anomalies.
   - Detection of hidden files, cloaked processes, unregistered network listeners, and inconsistencies in system call responses.
   - Signature-based approach for intrusion detection, analyzing log data using regular expressions for indicators of compromise.

2. **Log Data Analysis** :page_with_curl:
   - LMC agents efficiently read operating system and application logs, forwarding data to a central manager for rule-based analysis.
   - Support for data collection via syslog from network devices or applications when agents are not deployed.
   - Rule sets to identify application or system errors, misconfigurations, malicious activities, policy violations, and operational issues.

3. **File Integrity Monitoring** :file_folder:
   - Active monitoring of the file system to track changes in file content, permissions, ownership, and attributes.
   - Native tracking of users and applications responsible for file modifications.
   - Combining file integrity monitoring with threat intelligence for identifying threats and satisfying regulatory compliance.

4. **Vulnerability Detection** :warning:
   - LMC agents pull software inventory data and correlate it with continuously updated CVE databases.
   - Identification of well-known vulnerable software for proactive security measures.

5. **Configuration Assessment** :gear:
   - Continuous monitoring of system and application configuration settings to ensure compliance with security policies.
   - Periodic scans to detect vulnerable, unpatched, or insecurely configured applications.
   - Customizable configuration checks and alerts with recommendations and compliance mapping.

6. **Incident Response** :rotating_light:
   - Out-of-the-box active responses to address active threats, including blocking access based on predefined criteria.
   - Remote command execution and system queries for identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) and performing incident response tasks.

7. **Regulatory Compliance** :clipboard:
   - Essential security controls to support compliance with industry standards and regulations.
   - Scalability and multi-platform support for meeting technical compliance requirements.
   - Widely used by payment processing companies and financial institutions to satisfy PCI DSS and other regulatory requirements.

8. **Cloud Security** :cloud:
   - Integration with popular cloud providers (e.g., Amazon AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for monitoring at an API level.
   - Rules to assess cloud environment configurations and identify weaknesses.
   - Lightweight and multi-platform agents for effective monitoring at the instance level.

9. **Containers Security** :whale:
   - Security visibility for Docker hosts and containers, monitoring behavior and detecting threats and vulnerabilities.
   - Native integration with Docker engine for monitoring images, volumes, network settings, and running containers.
   - Continuous collection and analysis of runtime information for alerting on potential threats.
