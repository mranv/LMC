# 🍳 LMC (Let Me Cook - Infopercept) Security Solution 🛡️

LMC Security Solution is a powerful and versatile free and open-source platform designed for threat prevention, detection, and response across diverse IT environments, including on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based systems. 🚀

## Key Use Cases and Capabilities 📚

1. Intrusion Detection 🚨
   - LMC agents perform comprehensive scans of monitored systems to identify malware, rootkits, and suspicious anomalies. 🕵️‍♂️
   - Detect hidden files, cloaked processes, unregistered network listeners, and inconsistencies in system call responses.
   - Server component uses signature-based approach for intrusion detection, analyzing collected log data using regular expressions to pinpoint indicators of compromise.

2. Log Data Analysis 📊
   - Efficiently read operating system and application logs, securely forwarding data to a central manager for rule-based analysis and storage. 🔎
   - Rule sets help identify application or system errors, misconfigurations, attempted and successful malicious activities, policy violations, and other security and operational issues.
   - Server can also receive data via syslog from network devices or applications.

3. File Integrity Monitoring 📂
   - Actively monitor the file system, track changes in file content, permissions, ownership, and attributes requiring attention. 👁️
   - Natively track users and applications responsible for creating or modifying files.
   - Combined with threat intelligence to identify threats or compromised hosts and aid in satisfying regulatory compliance standards.

4. Vulnerability Detection 🛡️
   - Agents pull software inventory data and correlate it with continuously updated databases of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
   - Proactively identify well-known vulnerable software, enabling organizations to take corrective action before potential attackers exploit weaknesses.

5. Configuration Assessment ⚙️
   - Monitor system and application configuration settings to ensure compliance with security policies, standards, and hardening guides.
   - Agents perform periodic scans to detect vulnerable, unpatched, or insecurely configured applications.
   - Customizable configuration checks to align with specific requirements.

6. Incident Response 🚒
   - Out-of-the-box active responses address active threats, enabling countermeasures based on predefined criteria. 🛡️
   - Facilitate remote command execution and system queries to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and perform live forensics and incident response tasks.

7. Regulatory Compliance 📝
   - LMC includes essential security controls to support organizations in achieving compliance with industry standards and regulations. ✅
   - Scalability and multi-platform support aid in meeting technical compliance requirements.
   - Web user interface provides reports and dashboards helpful for various regulations like PCI DSS, GPG13, or GDPR.

8. Cloud Security ☁️
   - Extend monitoring capabilities to cloud infrastructure by integrating with well-known cloud providers like Amazon AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud at an API level.
   - Integration modules extract security data from cloud providers and provide rules to assess cloud environment configurations.

9. Containers Security 🐳
   - Ensure security visibility for Docker hosts and containers, monitoring their behavior and detecting threats, vulnerabilities, and anomalies.
   - Native integration with the Docker engine enables monitoring of images, volumes, network settings, and running containers.
   - Continuous collection and analysis of detailed runtime information, providing alerts for potential threats.
